Build for goal: {{GOAL}}

Plan file: {{PLAN_PATH}}

You are the builder. Follow the plan at {{PLAN_PATH}}:
- Pick the top unchecked item and complete it fully (no placeholders).
- Make direct edits to the repo under `workdir`.
- Run any obvious quick checks for touched stack (skip if none are applicable).
- Update {{PLAN_PATH}}: mark done items `- [x]`, add new `- [ ]` if needed, keep priorities. End with `STATUS: DONE` if nothing remains, else `STATUS: READY`.

Keep `AGENTS.md` operational only; no diaries.
