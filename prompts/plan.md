Plan for goal: {{GOAL}}

Plan file: {{PLAN_PATH}}

You are the planner. Ignore any existing plan content and write a fresh `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with:
- A 1–2 sentence scope summary for the goal.
- A prioritized checklist with `- [ ]` items (or `- [x]` if something is already done).
- Keep tasks concise and concrete (code files or assets to touch).
- End with a status line: `STATUS: READY` if work remains, `STATUS: DONE` if nothing to do.

Do not implement code. Write the plan to {{PLAN_PATH}}. Output only the new plan content.
